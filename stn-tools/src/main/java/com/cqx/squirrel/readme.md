Introduce

squirrel-foundation is a State Machine library, which provided a lightweight, easy use, type safe and programmable state machine implementation for Java.

===========

Untyped State Machine

In order to simplify state machine usage, and avoid too many generic types (e.g. StateMachine<T, S, E, C>) which may make code hard to read in some case, but still keep important part of type safety feature on transition action execution, UntypedStateMachine was implemented for this purpose.
